                    I'm a full-stack web developer with excellent problem-solving skills; 
                    I have strong attention to detail with the ability to deliver appropriate 
                    and efficient solutions. My critical thinking ability and hungriness 
                    to solve problems have allowed my teams to finish our projects 
                    quickly and elegantly. The finished projects have user-friendly 
                    UI with many use-cases tested. Learning new skills and library is 
                    exciting and I am ready to learn more every day.
